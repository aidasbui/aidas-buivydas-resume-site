# Resume website of Front-end developer Aidas Buivydas

## Hi there!

This is my personal project that acts as a resume or portfolio. Feel free to check out the code and let me know if you find any bugs. :)

## Tools used:

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Vite
- React Router v6
- ESLint and Prettier

You can check out the `package.json` file for full information.

Note: it's my first time using TailWind CSS and setting up a project with Vite (nice opportunity to learn), so some things may be sub-optimal. Feel free to comment on the project structure, I'd love to learn some new tricks! ;)
